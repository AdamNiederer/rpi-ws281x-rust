# Welcome to the Rust Bindings for rpi_ws281x
This project is going through major overhauls, so expect breaking
changes on most version changes.

## Usage
Currently in major flux, mroe details when I finish the "Stage 1" overhaul.
The current version on crates.io is pretty close to a bare bindgen wrap of
the C library.  The next version will look a lot more like typical Rust,
inspired by the efforts of @Meh who wrote manual bindings to this libray
a while back.

## Contributing
Code is licensed under the MIT license, so as long as you are cool with
that, feel free to open an issue, talk about proposed changes, then open
a PR!  I would love a helping hand, just have to make sure things don't
get too messy either.
